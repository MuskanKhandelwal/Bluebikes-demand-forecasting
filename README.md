# BlueBikes Demand Prediction 

This project aims to predict the demand for BlueBikes using historical data and station information. The goal is to deploy an MLOps pipeline that automates data ingestion, model training, deployment, and retraining. 

## Project Structure
- **data/**: Stores raw and processed datasets.
- **notebooks/**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for data exploration.
- **src/**: The source code for data ingestion, preprocessing, training, and inference.
- **models/**: Stores trained model artifacts.
- **tests/**: Unit and integration tests for various components of the pipeline.
- **docker/**: Docker-related files for containerization.
- **airflow/**: Contains DAGs for automating pipelines using Apache Airflow.
- **ci/**: Files for Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD) setup.
- **requirements.txt**: A list of dependencies required for the project.
